# HTML and CSS Projects
Here are a few sample websites that I created using HTML5 and CSS3.

## Projects
- [Space Station Site](https://github.com/shay-d16/HTML5-and-CSS3-Projects/tree/main/Basic_HTML_and_CSS/Space%20Station%20Project)
- [Movie Theater Site](https://github.com/shay-d16/HTML5-and-CSS3-Projects/tree/main/Basic_HTML_and_CSS/Movie%20Theatre%20Project)
- Bath Bomb Site
- Portfolio Site

#### Space Station Project
This webpage is an example home page for a space travel company. On this page I use a nav bar, image containers, and a form.

#### Movie Theatre Site
This is an example webpage for a Movie Theater that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootpstrap components, such as a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.

#### Bath Bomb Project
Here, I utilized the same navbar, form, and image container components from the Space Station project, but experimented with different styles in CSS.

#### Portfolio Project
This is my current portfolio, which showcases what I have learned so far with HTML and CSS. I will be adding to it throught my Software Developer Bootcamp as I learn more computer languages.
